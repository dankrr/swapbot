1. First follow Tutorial.txt

2. When done, go to main folder and click 'start.bat' -> This will start your bot





*********************************


To Start the bot you have 2 options:

double click start.bat - this will start the bot while keeping the console open (but bot may crash and not restart itself) -> Stop the bot by closing start.bat

double click start forever.bat - this will start the bot while keeping the console closed (but bot will restart itself if it crashes) -> To stop the bot, double click stop.bat


* If you want to make changes in the config (for example card rates), stop the bot, then go to config and make whatever changes you want, then start the bot again.
